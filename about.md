Hello there. My name is Yarosky Cruz. I'm originally from Puerto Rico, but been living in Central Florida for almost a decade now.

I've been making websites for a least a decade. I've been tinkering with HTML and CSS ever since I got my first Desktop back in the early aughts. I remember having to choose Doctypes back then. In 2017 I finished my degree in Interactive Design. This gave me a stronger foundation on Web Design, and some very junior level Front End Dev skills. Since then I have leveled up my Front End skills by taking over a dozen courses online. I'm currently enrolled in [UCF's Full Stack Coding BootCamp](https://bootcamp.ce.ucf.edu/coding/). 

When I'm not slinging code I'm hanging out with my beautiful girlfriend and my dog Oliver.
