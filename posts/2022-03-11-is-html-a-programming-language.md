The [following video](https://briefs.video/videos/is-html-a-programming-language/) answers _"a question that has never been asked before and has certainly not in any way caused a great number of arguments and nobody has ever been blocked or muted on social media for asking it."_

While hilarious, it was also a bit painful to watch, since [I've definitely sounded like one of the people](https://yarocruz.netlify.app/posts/html-and-css-is-a-language-can-you-read/) being mocked in the video.
