#### No Web Design Job 

Still haven't landed a job as a Web Designer, Interactive Designer, or anything related to my degree since the last time I wrote about it [here](https://yarocruz.github.io/im-only-getting-started/). It's been 7 months. I've gotten about 3 to 4 solid interviews. They were interviews that seem to have gone really well, but for some reason these potential employers never got back to me. I tried emailing them to ask for feedback and advice, but got nada. They ghosted me. It's been frustrating and discouraging, making me do some soul searching, and even [considering just giving up on it](https://www.designernews.co/stories/93486-its-ok-to-quit-right). 

I'm still unclear on what path to take. I've considered just moving away completely from design, and focus on web development, but I still love design. I'm just trying to figure out what my core skill is.

#### Junior Front-End Developer?

Speaking of Web Development, I recently completed [Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). I have a better idea of what [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is for and understand what's going on in the back end. I also finished an intro to React on Treehouse and have been reading the [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html). It's all beginning to click with me.

#### I'm Full-time

After a decade of being part of the under-employed class, working part-time service-sector McJobs, I'm finally part of the lower-middle income bracket class now. 

#### I'm Quitting Smoking, Again

I had quit smoking a couple of years ago, but relapsed around last year. I'm going full cold turkey. As of this writing, or by the time I publish this blog post, it's been a little over 24 hours. Wish me luck.
