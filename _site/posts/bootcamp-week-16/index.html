        <p>We did it! We finished our Project numero dos. It is live right now on <a href="https://sheltered-gorge-46855.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a> As of now, the project has <a href="https://github.com/yarocruz/project-2">102 commits</a>. There's definitely more that can be done. It has some bugs, the front end ui logic can be improved and polished more, but I think we did a pretty good job. The web app does de basic job of pulling and adding to a database.</p>
<p>I learned a lot with this project. Definitely feeling more confident with code that's on the backend. Unless writing SQL joins and inserts is your jam, Sequelize makes it so much simpler to deal with MySQL queries.</p>
<p>I also think that my Git and Github skills improved tremendously by working on this project. I'm sure there's more for me to learn about Git workflows when working in a group, but know I have a better idea what to expect when collaborating on a project. Adding things like branch merge protections and working with ES Lint, kept everyone in check, so there weren't any major issues with that aspect.</p>
<p>There's always some hiccups working with other people. Some people are gonna be more into the project than others. Some people's skillset may be either above or below your level. Some stay behind and some get way ahead. Some people don't seem to be into coding at all. But all you need is some communication. Using something like <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>, or Github's own <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards">Project Boards</a> helps a ton in giving everyone some direction. However this kinda stuff can cause some friction with the group if it's not clearly established if someone is officially the lead Dev. Like I'm sure I came off as dick by assigning people tasks. All I wanted was to get the thing done before due date. But I digress. This is why they have project managers in the industry.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how much of these experiences will reflect the real world out there. I think all the Bootcampers will agree with me that none of us are ready to start a startup in Silicon Valley. I think the Instructor and the TA's are doing a good job in stressing why this stuff like Github workflows, using things like linters, branches, naming branches, good commit messages, etc... This stuff is gonna matter, specially if you're going to work in house with a company, or an agency.</p>
<p>Coming up next week we start with Non SQL databases, MongoDB, and Mongoose.</p>
