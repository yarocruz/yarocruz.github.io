[The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI](https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest)

Maggie Appleton writes a thought provoking essay on the future of the web and where it's headed when more of the information getting produced is generated by AI instead of humans. 

> We're about to drown in a sea of pedestrian takes. An explosion of noise that will drown out any signal. Goodbye to finding original human insights or authentic connections under that pile of cruft.

She sees a future where will be questioning more and more the *realness* of people online and we will have to find ways to prove it.

> After the forest expands, we will become deeply sceptical of one another's realness. Every time you find a new favourite blog or Twitter account or Tiktok personality online, you'll have to ask: Is this really a whole human with a rich and complex life like mine? Is there a being on the other end of this web interface I can form a relationship with?

There's a lot to process. Highly recommended read.
