According to bloggers that blog about blogging, on your first post you're supposed to talk a bit about yourself and explain what you're going to be writing about. I'm doing no such thing. That's setting an expectation and I'm not about to do that because I have no expectations. I'm not expecting this blog to build my brand or reach an audience. I'm not trying to make it as a blogger. There will be no topics or niches I will be focusing on. I have no big plans with this. The only plan I have is to write and to try to do it consistently. What about, I can't specifically say other than what I find interesting. This is a place to archive my thoughts, to give myself a reason to get my fingers moving and my brain churning. This is just my little corner on the web. This is just for me.
