I'm finally done with college and I'm getting my degree in Interactive Design. I did the required Portfolio Review interviews last Tuesday night. I presented [my work](http://yaroskycruz.com) as best as I could. I was anxious and nervous. I did three rounds of interviews with about five people. At the end of the night I was emotionally exhausted.

I kept telling myself that it was all going well, that this is just practice and not real world job interviews. But after I was done and got home, it really made me question if my projects were any good. I got some positive feedback as well as some negative feedback. That was expected. As a web designer I thought of my skills as being somewhere between good and great. After Portfolio Review night though, I felt that I'm somewhere between bad and good.

I know that I have to keep improving my work, but telling yourself that vs hearing it from others is a whole different ball game. You always treat yourself more kindly and it's hard to break your own ego.

Even though I'm in a weird funk right now, with the question "what now?" echoing loudly in my head, there's no way I'm letting this experience discourage me. I'm going to keep pushing. I'm going to keep learning and I will be updating my [Portfolio](http://yaroskycruz.com) forever until the end of times. I'm on a new journey and I'm only getting started.
