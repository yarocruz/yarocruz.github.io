        <p>I'm finally done with college and I'm getting my degree in Interactive Design. I did the required Portfolio Review interviews last Tuesday night. I presented my work. as best as I could. I was anxious and nervous. I did three rounds of interviews with about five people. At the end of the night I was emotionally exhausted.</p>
<p>I kept telling myself that it was all going well, that this is just practice and not real world job interviews. But after I was done and got home, it really made me question if my projects were any good. I got some positive feedback as well as some negative feedback. That was expected. As a web designer I thought of my skills as being somewhere between good and great. After Portfolio Review night though, I felt that I'm somewhere between bad and good.</p>
<p>I know that I have to keep improving my work, but telling yourself that vs hearing it from others is a whole different ball game. You always treat yourself more kindly and it's hard to break your own ego.</p>
<p>Even though I'm in a weird funk right now, with the question &quot;what now?&quot; echoing loudly in my head, there's no way I'm letting this experience discourage me. I'm going to keep pushing. I'm going to keep learning and I will be updating my Portfolio forever until the end of times. I'm on a new journey and I'm only getting started.</p>
