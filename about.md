Hey there. My name is Yarosky Cruz. I'm a Web Developer based in Orlando, FL.

I've been making websites for a least a decade. I think I started tinkering with HTML and CSS back when I got my first Desktop PC in the early aughts. I remember having to choose Doctypes back then. In 2017 I finished my degree in Interactive Design. This gave me a foundation in Design and some entry level Front End Dev skills. Since then I have leveled up my Front End skills by taking over a dozen courses online. I'm currently enrolled in [UCF's Full Stack Coding BootCamp](https://bootcamp.ce.ucf.edu/coding/).

This site is just my humble off-the-radar web log. I started it in 2017 as a general purpose blog, but for the past few months I've been posting once a week about my Coding Bootcamp journey. 

If you wanna see my coding skills you can checkout my proper [portfolio site](http://yarocruz.surge.sh/).

When I'm not slinging code I'm hanging out with my beautiful girlfriend and my dog Oliver.
