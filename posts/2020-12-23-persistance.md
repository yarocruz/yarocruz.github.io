I'm always worried that staying persistent in the face of constant rejection is a form a self delusion, because there's no way you can prove that it's not. People say that you should keep going. Stay consistent. Keep trying. Never quit, never surrender. [Just Do It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0) It's gonna happen eventually.

I do believe that if you want something really badly, you will find a way to get it. You spend enough time pursuing something, eventually you'll get there. But I still worry of seeming foolish, naive, oblivious. I feel sometimes like [Tommy Wiseau in The Disaster Artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Disaster_Artist_(film)) or like that [French guy in Exit through the Gift Shop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Brainwash). Even though these guys achieved "success", they achieved it for the wrong reasons.

I know I'm not *that* deluded, oblivious, and crazy like Tommy Wiseau or Mr. Brainwash. I know what I know, what I don't know, and that there are even more things that I don't know that I don't know. See [unknown unknowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns).

Twenty twenty has been an extremely sucktastic year for a lot of people, but we gotta keep going right? And yeah, being persistent and gritty is a little bit on the crazy spectrum, but at least we're doing what makes us happy.

And maybe all this is just the holiday blues kicking in. Happy Holiday's yall.
