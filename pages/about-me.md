Hi, I'm Jay Cruz and I'm a Software Developer based in Orlando, FL. I mostly dabble in client and server-side JavaScript to build websites and web apps. I use [React](https://reactjs.org/) and sometimes [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) for building client side interfaces, and I like the [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), Node / Express stack.

This site is just my humble off-the-radar web log where I've been documenting my journey into this new career, what I've been learning, and other miscellanea.

When I'm not slinging code I'm hanging out with my beautiful girlfriend and my dog Oliver.
