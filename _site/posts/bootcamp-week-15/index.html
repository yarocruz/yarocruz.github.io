        <p>On week 15 we started with our second group project. I was worried how working in groups through Zoom was gonna be, but it has been working out pretty good. Better in some ways than in IRL. At least compared to my first experience. It's probably a combination of different factors. First off, having that first experience prepared me for this one. Another factor is that since we are quarantined, we are sort of forced to communicate better. The whole &quot;let's meetup on Tuesday&quot; and having no one show up is not an issue because there's Slack and Zoom. Finally, the main factor I think the project is running smoothly is because I've been leading the project, and my group has been on board with me. Picking the idea, which I will get to in a minute, kinda forced me to do some project management. For this one I used the Kanban Project tool on Github and I think that has helped a lot in figuring out how we can divide the tasks. For the most part, we've been decent with our Git and Github workflow. We're branching off of master, pushing and pulling those branches, deleting when it's merged, and starting that process all over again. With this project I'm also learning a ton about Git and Github. One of the many requirements for this group project was that we have to use a Linter and Travis CI. I hated using these two tools at first, but know I'm kinda loving them.</p>
<p>So our web app is going to be essentially a CRUD app. It needs to use Node with Express, a MySQL database, a CSS library other than Bootstrap, and it must use Handlebars. It must follow the MVC paradigm. So we decided on a Podcast Directory. More specifically, a user driven Podcast directory were you can discover people's listening tastes when it comes to podcasts. The reason I suggested this was because it pretty much fills the requirements of the project.</p>
<p>We are using Sequelize as our ORM. It really makes it easier to work with SQL queries. I'm using Tailwind CSS and I'm loving it. The project is like 70% done. We be committing and merging. At the moment it has 79 commits in total, with 13 successful pull request merges.</p>
