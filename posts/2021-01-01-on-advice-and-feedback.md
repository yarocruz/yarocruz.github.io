summary: When people's experience and skill level are way above yours, many of the things you still don't understand are so obvious to them

I realize how important it is to learn from others and to seek out feedback from people with more experience, specially when you're trying to enter into a career in web development. The more info and advice you can get from those that have taken the journey you're about to take the better. It's the smart thing to do. But I also realize that not every feedback and advice you receive is going to be helpful.

Even when the person is genuinely trying to be helpful, they sometimes absolute suck at it. Because not everyone can teach. When people's experience and skill level are way above yours, many of the things you still don't understand are so obvious to them. They lost the beginners mind.

The other problem with career advice is that each person's path is unique. It's random. And there is definitely luck involved. There are so many people out there that are not aware of [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) and if they are, some don't want to acknowledge it.

If there's a good piece of advice I heard and read is that you have to focus on the things you can control. Getting a job is not under your control. You can take the actions that will get you closer to getting it, like applying to the job, going to the interview, and doing all the other things, but after that, it is not up to you. This why you **get** a job, and not **take** a job. You don't take it, it is given.

But like the saying goes, take every advice 'with a grain of salt'. Even this, even though this is really not advice.
