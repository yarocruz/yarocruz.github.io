Like many, the first time I encountered [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) was when I typed **git commit** into a terminal, forgetting to type the -m flag. I don't think I even knew what Vim was when it happened. All I knew is that I had no idea where I was or how to get out.

Once I started digging more into Text Editors I eventually became aware of it, but only enough to know what it was. I read a bit about it, watch some videos, and went through the first free levels of [Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/). I learned at least the arrow keys (**hjkl**), how to move by words with **w** and **b** but never stuck with it long enough to really like get [Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiwGbcd8S7I&t=3165s) level skills.

It wasn't until recently that I started to get back into it. I think what re-sparked my interest was watching [this talk were Ryan Florence explains how Hooks work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jWS7cCuUXw&t=1740s) and he just clackity clacks like some type of animal keyboard wizard.

So I installed the Vim Emulator on my Webstorm. Watched some more videos on YouTube. Went through the [vimtutor](http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/teaching/unix/vimtutor). But things were still not sticking.

At some point I stumbled upon [Michael Chan's](https://twitter.com/chantastic?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) series [Vim from A - Z](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnc_NxpmOxaNqdGvUg8RBi8ZTaZGPdqBD). Something clicked when I started going through it and for some reason I thought about [KCD's Learning Clubs](https://kentcdodds.com/clubs/) and how this could be an excellent curriculum to learn with a group.

So I went through the [guide](https://kentcdodds.com/clubs/), took to it to [his Discord](https://kentcdodds.com/discord/). Kent liked it and asked me to add to his [curriculum and templates ideas README](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-learning-clubs-ideas) which is pretty freaking cool!

I've be tracking my study progress by taking some [notes](https://www.notion.so/Vim-Alphabet-8d674cfa0b11447184b3b7423d569dba) and sharing it with the group. I'm at the letter F, but I'm already doing w to move forward, i to insert, v to select, p to put(paste) and some more. There's still things that don't feel as intuitive yet, like remembering that you can add a [count] to a movement key. I'm nowhere near good at Vim and I know that there's so much more to dig into, but I think it's finally starting to stick.

I highly recommend learning at least the basics of Vim if you're learning to code. At least enough so that it will spark your curiosity to learn your text editor a bit more. I also recommend learning with others to some capacity. Having that bit of sense of accountability helps with the learning process tremendously. Kent C Dodd's Learning Clubs on Discord are excellent and it's pretty easy to start one.
