[Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/) is an amazing Instructor and his courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) are hands down one of the best courses you can get on the platform, specially if you're starting to learn Web Development. His [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/101W9C3@ijEPUFhZlTmTl_Pk-FYlvIH-Ci9wS3Pvo_E-qph9rRz90mvEXnCinrVguObrwEMF/) is legendary. 

I recently got his [Git & Github Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-bootcamp/learn/lecture/25090990?start=15#overview) course. This course is shorter than his typical courses but it's still so darn good. 

I've been using Git and Github for years and I always felt that I was decent at it. But after going through the course I realized how little I actually knew about Git and Github. All the other topics that I felt fuzzy about, like **branches** and **merging**, we're cleared up. Other "advanced" topics like [Rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing), which is something that I knew about, but never really explored, have blown my mind. 

He does such a great job at explaining things and his slides are just excellent. I highly recommend it if you want to get your git fundamentals straightened out and dig a bit deeper with Git and Github.
