Currently in the process of listing some of my projects here. I'm going through my old interactive Portfolio site and seeing what I can add, discard, or update. In the meantime you can check out [my repos](https://github.com/yarocruz). Of note is my US States projects below which I'm hoping to add more useful features and make it into a bigger project.
