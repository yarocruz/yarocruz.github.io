I completed yet another "second round" of job application tests. It was for a Front End Developer role. It was more of a [Front of the Front End role](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/). You know, the 2000's Front End Web Developer. Not today's Front End React Engineer Web Developer.

The tests weren't anything like the kind of tests you would expect. They were a series of mostly behavioral questions. Some of them were technical, like "what is your knowledge of SEO?". But the most technical thing they asked was to take a PSD and convert it into a pixel perfect HTML! This threw me off hard.

I'm sure that old school **Front of Front End** Devs that read [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) and [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) can take a Designer's PSD file and spit out a pixel perfect landing page, with a [Carousel](https://shouldiuseacarousel.com/), in just a couple of minutes, but the PSD I was given had a non-trivial layout, with guides, layers, and a Carousel. This was something that could've taken me a couple of hours. Days even.

I still wanted to complete the application, but it was required for me to upload a file in order to submit the application. I ended up writing an HTML file with two **p** tags that said, "This should be paid work. This is not a couple of minutes/under one hour job".

I expected that it was going to be one those Web Designer/Developer roles. In the job requirements they list jQuery and WordPress. But a PSD file?!
