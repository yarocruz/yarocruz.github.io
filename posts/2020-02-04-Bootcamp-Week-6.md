This is gonna be a short one. Week 6 was all about working with server side apis. There were some mini lectures, but we spent more time on in-class coding exercises. We were introduced to examples of some purely data API's like [OMDb](http://www.omdbapi.com/), [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and how to discover them using services like [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/). To make requests we're still using jQuery since it has the .ajax() method. There was a bit of an explanation about Asynchronous vs Synchronous code, but we didn't go to deep into topics like the old XMLHttpRequest. 

The [Work Day Planner](https://github.com/yarocruz/workday-scheduler) was due this week. The project that's due for the end of the upcoming week is a Weather app that uses the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API.

The next two weeks of the Bootcamp are going to be interesting. We're starting the first group project. I'm excited and super curios on how working in a group is gonna work out.
