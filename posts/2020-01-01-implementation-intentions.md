Do not make resolutions this year. Do not list your goals as to-do items you'll get to check off, because you won't. Instead, let's make implementation intentions this year. 

> An implementation intention (II) is a self-regulatory strategy in the form of an "if-then plan" that can lead to better goal attainment, as well as help in habit and behavior modification. It is subordinate to goal intentions as it specifies the when, where and how portions of goal-directed behavior. The concept of implementation intentions was introduced in 1999 by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer.

According to James Clear, author of [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-habit-James-Clear/dp/B07XVLMQGV?pf_rd_p=dd4f5b57-ba5b-418b-a348-64ec62df14cc&pd_rd_wg=jPpdj&pf_rd_r=6HG4WGTPH8VT7WWGDGHM&ref_=pd_gw_cr_simh&pd_rd_w=NE3tn&pd_rd_r=49c08fc4-5879-4114-b422-139b269b4f1a) the problem with goals is that they rely on being "motivated" and are usually vague. An [implementation intention](https://jamesclear.com/implementation-intentions) on the other hand is the act of being specific. It makes you identify the the where and when.

So this year stop being vague. Get to the nitty gritty and make shit happen!

Happy New Year!
