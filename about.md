I am many things, and have been many things, but one of the main identities I've gone by is Designer. I've called myself a Web Designer, Graphic Designer, Visual Designer, and Interactive Designer. Never Ux Designer because that seems to high level to me, and Ui Designer has always seem implicit. If you design anything digital and interactive you are always designing a user interface.

I also like to call myself a Front-End Web Developer. I have the chops to markup, style, and give a website some interactivity. These are the roles I have given myself. This is a career I'm pursuing. This is what I went to school for and got a degree in. I'm a Designer and Front-End Developer.

More importantly, I'm trying to become a better Front-End Developer. I've been focused on learning Web Development and really learning JavaScript. It be cool one day to get paid for doing this stuff, but I'll probably keep doing this because it's fun. As cliched as it is, I just love making things.
