After reading Chris Coyier's article [The Great Divide](https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/) and then Brad Frost's recent [Frontend Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/) post, I'm more certain that the specialization of being a Web Designer is no longer a thing. Seeing others articulate something that I've experienced and tried to [articulate myself](https://yarocruz.github.io/smart-goals-and-100-days-of-coding/) makes me feel reassured. I feel sad too, because for better or for worse the industry has killed the middle man. Brad Frost's "Frontend Designer" title is really just another way of saying Web Designer, but I like that it's more implicit in saying that you can code markup, can sling some front-end JS, and that you care about aesthetics and shit.
