It's been 9 days of [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com). I'm keeping a log in [this forked Github repo](https://github.com/yarocruz/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md). I'm also using [Codepen.io to post up the code](https://codepen.io/collection/DLybaR/).

It's been challenging to keep it up for the past 9 days, but Iâ€™ve soldiered on. The only time I had available this week was after work. Which means that I had to wait to drive back home, shower, and have dinner. Usually around 7pm to 8pm was when I ended up having my coding session. I also worked 8 days in a row, like some kind of animal.

But I did it. I was physically and mentally drained, but I stuck to it. And that's the whole idea right? To make it a habit? To make it stick?

If there's anything I'm learning more than typing correct JavaScript syntax, it's learning how to learn. I think I'm doing good with making it part of my daily routine, but I'm not so sure how effective it is to code for 1 hour just to code for 1 hour. It's not easy to figure out how to learn and find exactly what you need to learn. It's hard to give yourself the most effective curriculum, but it isn't impossible.

All I know is that I will keep tweaking it. The plan for next week is to try to do it early in the morning before work. I also need to come up with more meaty projects that are on my level. I'm noticing that I either come up with super simple projects that don't help me get to that next level, or I jump into way over-my-head projects.

I just don't want to fall into the [tutorial purgatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxxAc9a4ILU) where I just clock in hours for the sake of clocking in the hours without making any substantial progress.
