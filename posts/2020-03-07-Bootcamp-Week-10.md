Week 10 was tough. It was a jammed-packed week for me. Lots of things going on. Good things. New things. Suffice to say, I've been busy. 

We started the week with Object Oriented Programming concepts. Covered constructor functions, the prototype method, inheritance, and how most things in JavaScript are Objects. This started getting trippy and too abstract for me, but I get it. This is all just a way to organize your code into
'blueprinted' pieces that you can reuse. 

We also looked at unit testing. Now this is trippy. You write code to test your code. We got to practice using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and have all our tests fail. It's fun...

The last thing we covered were classes which is syntactic sugar for constructor functions. I actually know what that sentence means now. It's just ES6 syntax that makes it cleaner to write constructor function. This has helped me a ton in understanding the foundation on how React Component classes work. 

The [Readme Generator](https://github.com/yarocruz/readme-generator) was the assignment due for the end of the week. 

Again, busy week. Good week. But I'm exhausted as I write this. Good stuff happening. 

Almost halfway.
