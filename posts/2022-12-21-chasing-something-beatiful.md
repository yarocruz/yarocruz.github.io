I have a bit of nostalgia for when I wanted to be a photographer. Back when I would chase the next “banger” to post on Instagram. I no longer want to be a photographer, that’s a tough racket and I have nothing but respect for people who manage to make a living out of taking pictures. But I do miss hunting down something beautiful to capture. I do miss taking photos.
