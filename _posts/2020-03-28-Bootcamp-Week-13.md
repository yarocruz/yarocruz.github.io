More SQL. We started bringing the back to the front. Bringing in those views. We started using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), a pretty neat templating tool. This week was all about using the Model View Controller approach to making web apps. Still wrapping my head around it. 

We're creating schemas and seed files. Doing queries that join tables. Creating the back-end with Express, Handlebars, and using jQuery to make the Ajax calls on the front end. We're CRUDING. Creating, reading, updating, and deleting. Middlewares. RESTful. Lot's of ALL-CAPS acronyms. 

The apps are getting more complex. The homework that was due this week, a [Node CLI app for managing employee data](https://github.com/yarocruz/employee-tracker) with SQL was the hardest one yet. It has kicked my ass. That code is a mess. It is not DRY at all. 

Doing the class remotely has gotten better though. Still not my favorite thing, but this is how is gonna be now. I think I'm getting the hang of it. I'm embracing it.

**Sidenote.

It's been a weird week. My employer, SeaWorld, sent a letter to 90% of its staff to let them know that they have been temporarily furloughed. I had to google furlough. It's the word of the week. It's like, 'you're fired, sort of, not really... we just can't pay you anymore. Ok. thx. bye." 

I'm oddly optimistic about this. I've been slowly tweaking my resume, paying more attention to LinkedIn, making sure I write good README's on my Github. I'm pretty sure I'll land something soon. Or maybe I'm still in shock, in some sort of denial that actually the world is ending. 

I think we'll be ok.
