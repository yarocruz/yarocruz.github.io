It's crunch time. Just five more days to go and we're done with the Bootcamp.
This will span a bit over a week since the last official day of class is on
June 15, 2020.

Things have gotten a bit rough for me for the past week or so. I thought that by this point I would be close to being job ready. I've
been applying to jobs since February, but I have only landed one interview.
I've lost count on how many applications I've done by this point. The feedback
I have received back from some people in the industry has been positive overall,
but it's been more in the lines of 'you still got a lot to learn kid' kind 
of feedback. So I'm feeling a bit discouraged. Ego is a bit down.

I'm hanging in there, but I'm struggling. The past few days of the Bootcamp
has been dedicated to the final group project and to brief lectures on the more
advanced Computer Science stuff like Big O Notation, Data Structures, and Algorithms.
I understand the general ideas, and why this stuff matters in terms of code
efficiency, I would totally fail at a whiteboarding interview where I'm asked
to refactor code to make it more efficient. 

The last project and last assignments we have to turn in are MERN apps. I thought
I had a good handle on server side development, but serving routes and then
consuming them on the client side is still a bit fuzzy on my brain.

I think I'm a bit burnt out.
