Week 21 was a shorter week. Technically, we're still not done with the week. 
It just got cut short to two days because of memorial day weekend. 

We started the week with an introduction to the MERN stack. This means
we will be putting together a React application with Express and Mongo to 
hook it up to a database. We went through some exercise examples to see
how this can be done. It's all stuff we have already covered. Creating
Model Schemas with Mongoose. Setting up servers and routes with Express.
The only difference is that we will be doing the client side with React.
 
We only have two projects left, one final homework and one final group project.
They gave us some starter code to start our projects, with scripts in the
package.json files that always got to the root of the project to start the 
server with Nodemon. 

Only three weeks left. There are only two more lecture classes left. We're 
going to cover Sorting Algorithms and Big O Notation. After that it's just 
project work.
