        <p>We're finally on React. I'm loving it. I have been tinkering with React for a couple of years, maybe since 2017, and I've gone through many tutorials where I learned the basics. The first time I attempted their <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">Tic Tac Toe tutorial</a> was rough and I got stuck halfway through. But on my second try I got it working. I have built a couple of <a href="https://yarocruz.github.io/the50states/">small projects</a> wit React as well. In sum, I'm not entirely new to React, so this week went buttery smooth for me.</p>
<p>On day one we went through the very basics and jumped right in with using create-react-app. We created our first functional components with JSX. We were shown how to style JSX elements and use { expressions } within JSX.</p>
<p>Day two we did props and state with class based Components. We did the classic increment and decrement counter exercise and ended the day working with a Friendlist app that grabbed local data from a JSON file and rendered them individually into FriendListCard components.</p>
<p>On the final day we worked with forms, onChange handlers, used Axios to make API calls, and we were introduced to ReactRouter.</p>
<p>This was a lot condensed into three days. React is described as a simple library for creating user interfaces, and it is, but that's only if you're at least decent at JavaScript. I remember the first time I tried out React I was completely baffled by it, but that's because I didn't have the fundamentals of JS locked down yet. For example, if you don't understand the basics of classes and class constructors, the whole class based components thing, with the <strong>this</strong> keyword jumping around everywhere, <strong>this</strong> is gonna be very confusing. See what I did there?</p>
<p>Next week we're jumping into Hooks and it looks like the remainder of the Bootcamp will be React based.</p>
<p>Only 5 weeks to go!</p>
