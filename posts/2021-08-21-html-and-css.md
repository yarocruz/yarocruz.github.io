_Update: The point I tried making with this post didn't come out they way I intended. Part of it is just bad writing and part if came out from some aimless anger and frustration I was feeling at the time. HTML and CSS are definitely programming languages. I apologize for sounding like the [ACKCHYUALLY guy](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/191/035/135.png)._ 

The problem with discussing if HTML and CSS are programming languages or not is that most of the time this debate really doesn't matter. It's just semantics. Bike shedding. Usually used as a way to put others down, or put others up, depending on which side it's coming from. HTML and CSS are languages. They are codes. They are instructions you're giving to a computer(the browser interpreter really, but let's not digress). In that loosely and broader sense, then yes, making a website with just HTML and CSS is programming.

I also acknowledge and agree that programmers with a traditional CS background, who know JavaScript really well, and other programming languages, are usually the ones who never miss an opportunity to let you know that HTML and CSS "aren't real programming languages". These people are definitely dicks who have no idea how much more complex and how much more important being good a writing correct and semantic HTML is. They have no idea how wickedly cool CSS is and how much more difficult it is to actually master it.


However, and playing devil's advocate a bit here, understanding what separates a programming language in the more academic and strict definition, on what makes a programming language a programming language, compared to something like HTML and CSS _matters sometimes_. It matters especially if your goal is to become a professional software developer. We can endlessly debate the semantics, and the loosely defined definitions on what makes a programming language a programming language, but there's no way you can do with HTML what you can do with a language like C++, Python, or even JavaScript. All programming languages typically have variables, numbers, strings, conditions, loops, booleans, functions, objects, and that's just covering the basics. Programming languages can be used in different platforms and environments. HTML and CSS are meant to be used inside web browsers.

My impression is that there's a subset of folks that get into these fights of HTML and CSS being 'real programming' as a crutch to avoid learning JavaScript and the 'computer sciency' aspects of Web Development. Particularly the Front-End purists that just want to make websites. Yes, you can make 'complex' websites with just HTML and CSS. Yes, in the world of front-end web development, there are still pockets in the industry with roles where you can get away with not knowing a whole lot of JavaScript. But in today's world of web applications, I don't believe this is the norm.

I'm not saying that HTML and CSS are less important than JavaScript, or as a less valuable skill. The main point I'm trying to get across is that you're not going to be able to avoid learning *some* JavaScript in the world of Web Development, no matter if the goal is front-end, because the presentational and design aspects of making websites and web apps, are either done by traditional web designers (graphic designers who can code), or it's a very specialized role in a small agency that mostly does branding and websites. But if your goal is to work in web application development, you will have a hard time clinging to the "HTML and CSS are languages too" stance and you will be judged, unfounded or not, as naive and as someone that clearly doesn't understand the full scope of what programming is. It's just a matter of understanding that distinction when it matters.
