I'm so glad I found [Tania Rascia's site](https://www.taniarascia.com/). There are many developers out there who do written tutorials, but her [guides](https://www.taniarascia.com/guides) are just superb, at least the ones I've gone through so far. Her [intro to React](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/) is one of the best out there. She recently redesigned her site [and wrote about it](https://www.taniarascia.com/another-website-redesign/). Her site is super slick and clean. She inspires me to follow in her footsteps of learning in public here with this blog.
