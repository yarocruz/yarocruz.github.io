This explainer article on NYT, [*The Latecomer's Guide to Crypto*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/cryptocurrency-crypto-guide.html?referringSource=articleShare) by Kevin Roose, while good at explaining the ideas behind cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and NFT's, didn't convince me that this is something I should pay any more attention to. Even if isn't all a scam, or some tech cult, I'm just not a finance person. I have never bought a stock and I probably google inflation every other week. From a programming perspective, I'm curios as to how this is built, and why so many young folks are so enthusiastic about web3. But overall, I don't understand where this web utopianism is coming from when this is something that's mostly about money.

[John Oliver explained it best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6iDZspbRMg) by saying that cryptocurrency is "everything you don't understand about money combined with everything you don't understand about computers."
