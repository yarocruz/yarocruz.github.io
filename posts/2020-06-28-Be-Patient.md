I finished re-reading Cal Newport's [So Good they Can't Ignore You](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-ebook/dp/B0076DDBJ6/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) a couple of days ago. Been thinking a lot lately about how people become wickedly good at what they do. I'm just trying to grab some ideas that I can put into practice in my own learning journey. Here's a great quote in So Good they Can't Ignore You that's pretty much the basis for the book title.

> In his 2007 interview with Charlie Rose, here's how Steve Martin explained his strategy for learning the banjo: "[I thought], if I stay with it, then one day I will have been playing for forty years, and anyone who sticks with something for forty years will be pretty good at it."
