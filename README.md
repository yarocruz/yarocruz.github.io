# This Is My Blog

This is my blog, there are many like it, but this one is mine.

It was built with Jekyll and uses a customized version of the Jekyll Minima theme.

[This is the boilerplate look of the theme](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/)

You can find the source code for the Minima Theme [here](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
