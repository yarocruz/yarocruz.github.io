I’m a Web Designer, technically a Graphic Designer who specializes in Interactive Design. That’s just a fancy way of saying that I know how to use software tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and can write entry level front-end code with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript/jQuery. To put it simply, I’m a designer who enjoys coding.

I’m not quite seasoned in the industry and ~~I’m about to graduate~~ I recently graduated from school, but I'm constantly learning new things. Frameworks like Bootstrap, CMS's like Wordpress, SASS, etc. Anything that will help me design better. I like tooling.

### Other Things About me that might be Interesting

- I'm a decent guitar player. I started playing when I was 16 and played in a couple of garage bands. Never "made it' in the business, but I still play my acoustic. My girlfriend says she loves to hear me play it.
- I was a computer tech for a while. Back in the Windows XP days. I installed drives and upgraded memories.
- I'm a Photographer at a water park in Central Florida.
- I like to read a lot.
