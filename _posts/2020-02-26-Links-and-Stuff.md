The [Vue.js Documentary](https://youtu.be/OrxmtDw4pVI) is one of the coolest things I've seen made about coding. It was made by a company called [Honeypot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsUalyRg43M8D60mtHe6YcA) and they have made short docs on [GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=783ccP__No8), [Ember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvz-9ccflKQ), and [Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxYFOM3UJzo). The [GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=783ccP__No8) was really good as well. 

The New York Magazine has an article on how [Lambda School is fudging their numbers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html) to entice students to enroll. Turns out, and this shouldn't be surprising to anyone in this industry, that there are way less students that find a job after finishing the Bootcamp than what the school claims. [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22366474) has a good discussion going reacting this article.

My favorite course so far on Udemy is [Colt Steele's Modern JavaScript Bootcamp Course 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/). I keep coming back to it to supplement what I'm learning from the Bootcamp.
