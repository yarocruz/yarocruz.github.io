I've watched many films and movies. There's a lot that I could list here as my all time favorites, but that's a list is constantly changing. So I'm gonna give this some thought. In the 2000's if you asked which was one of my favorite movies, I would've responded immediately with [Fight Club](https://letterboxd.com/film/fight-club/). But today, even though I still think it's a brilliant film, I'm not sure if I would put it as my top favorite. 

In the meantime I'll be tracking what I've watched so far this year.
