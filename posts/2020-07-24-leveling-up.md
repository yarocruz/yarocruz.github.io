I've been stuck in [the Valley](https://yarocruz.github.io/the-valley-of-despair/) but I'm trying to move forward. I'm trying to get to that Slope of Enlightenment. 

Been going back to the drawing board. Getting back to the fundamentals and whatnot. I recently finished reading the newest editions of the two [You Don't Know JS Yet series](https://www.amazon.com/You-Dont-Know-JS-Yet-ebook/dp/B084BNMN7T/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1FOS8KE9WWYAJ&dchild=1&keywords=you+don%27t+know+js&qid=1595638846&sprefix=you+don%2Caps%2C172&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzMVVNRVJOU05VUVVQJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzUyMTUyMVQwNDdPVFM1NEpCUSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNDg5OTQ4M1VRRUhNS0o5UkNFOSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) books. Your mileage may vary depending on how long you've been writing JavaScript if you decide on picking these up, but I still recommend them, if you want to get a stronger foundation with JS. You can checkout the [previous editions](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/README.md) as well.

I finished doing a [WordPress Course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/) and reverse engineered the project a bit and made a super basic theme I named [Austerus](http://jayc1.sgedu.site/). Help, I'm obsessed with the word austere for some reason.

I started this [repo](https://github.com/yarocruz/fundamentals) because I thought that I could do Twitch, but I mostly started it to just keep myself active on Github. Gotta keep making those commits. I wrote about [variables](https://yarocruz.github.io/fundamentals/). I've been taking a stab at teaching as a way to learn and solidify my knowledge, but man, this stuff takes quite some time. 

I finished the [FCC JavaScript Algorithms](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) course.

I've been playing with the idea of making an [RSS Reader web app](https://github.com/yarocruz/austere-reader) because I really miss Web 2.0. Like, do you guys remember when you saw Last.fm for the first time, Digg, and FriendFeed? Remember Delicious? God I miss those days and just aged myself. About the RSS app tho, I'm still researching the logistics. I've seen some cool ones made with React and Vue. I've been taking a look at [Feedly](https://feedly.com/). What I'm trying to figure out is if some feeds don't adhere to the RSS spec? This is still something that I'm incubating. 

I have about 13 unfinished courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) of the 19 that I have.

I also have [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/). They had a lot of deals the past months. 
They got some good quality stuff there. 

I bought two O'Reilly books, [Learning React](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492051721/ref=nav_timeline_asin?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1), and [Programming TypeScript](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R86FL4K/ref=nav_timeline_asin?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1). I'm loving the Learning React one.
The chapter on functional programming, composing, and Higher Order Components is fire.

I'm been playing a bit with PHP and Python on the side as well. 

I'm all over the place.
